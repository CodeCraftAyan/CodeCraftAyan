# @CodeCraftAyan

Hello, and thanks for visiting my GitHub repo!

I'm *Ayan Mandal*, but many people also know me as **Ayan**. a self-taught developer who loves building tools, exploring systems, and learning by doing. 

My journey into tech began out of pure curiosity, and over time it evolved into a deep interest in understanding both high-level applications and the low-level logic behind how things work. From writing Python scripts and developing full-stack web apps to diving into system-level concepts, I enjoy turning ideas into real, usable solutions.
